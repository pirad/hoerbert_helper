# hoerbert_helper
My bash script for filling the sd card, to run in the Hörbert hardware (see https://de-de.hoerbert.com/).

This project is inofficial and has no relation to the company winzki, that creates the Hörbert.

As language for the user interface I chose german.

Needed tools:
* sox (with the codecs to decode your files)
* zenity
